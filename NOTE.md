# NOTES

There are still some issues left for the calcaltor. For exmaple, the issue with the praser is that there's no "type" system; thus, the prasing is soly based on symbols. If statements, in this way, is dynamically typed in terms of its return values. (For short circuiting the recursion, we can't implement type analysis by fully evaluate both clause and compare the result)Moreover, consecutive compare symbol is also hard to implement (e.g 1 < x < 2) It might be better to short circuit type errors during parsing.
