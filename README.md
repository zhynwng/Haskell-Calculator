# Haskell-Calculator
This is a simple Turing-Complete calculator constructed by Haskell. This adapted from one of labs in the course CMSC 16100 at the University of Chicago. I have not taken the course personally; this is purely done through self-interests. 

To run the calculator, first compile the program through GHC, the run Main, which can be done through the following two commands: 
$ ghc Main.hs
$ ./Main

The calculator can handle infix operations like normal calculators. It also supports let expressions (can be used to define variables), if-then-else statements, and lambda expressions.
